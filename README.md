An **economy** refers to an area of production, distribution, or trade, along with consumption, for different agents within a specific geographical location across various countries. It encompasses aspects such as culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure, legal systems, and natural resources that shape its processes. Economies can be categorized into types like market economies (where production and exchange are based on demand and supply) or planned economies (where the government controls what is produced and how it's distributed). Additionally, a green economy emphasizes low-carbon growth driven by resource efficiency.
